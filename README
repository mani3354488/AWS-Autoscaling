Without Autoscaling

1.First create an EC2 instance on AWS(Amazon web services).
2.Then Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH.
3.Create your server.py file on the EC2 instance(please find the server.py file that i used in the report).
4.Before running the server.py file,install flask(python web framework on AWS)
5.Command to install flask is : $ sudo pip install flask
6.After installing flask run the server.py as $ sudo python server.py
7.In the client.py file replace the already existing IP with the IP of your EC2 instance.
8.Also adjusts the number of requests,the message to be send etc in the client.py file.
9.Run the client.py file while the server.py file is running on EC2 instance.



With Autoscaling

1.As we have already created the EC2 instance in the previous part.Create its AMI(bootable image).
2.Now go to launch configurations and select the AMI created in the previous step.Also on the user data section write the shell command to run your server i.e sudo python /home/ubuntu/server.py this command will get executed everytime when a new instance is created.
3.Now consider the auto scaling group with desire configurations like scaling policies ,min and max instances desired etc.
4.Now configure the classical load balancer and set the target groups.
